3.1
	A. The number of built in functions is bound at language design time.
	B. The variable decleration is bound at compile time.
	C. The max length allowed for a constant is bound at language implementation time. 
	D. The referencing environment for a subroutine is bound at the same time as the referencing environment.
	E. The address of a particular library routine is bound by the linker.
	F. The total amount of space occupied is bound at run time.

3.5
	A. The program prints: 
		 1  1
		 3  1
		 1  2
	B. The program prints:
		 1  2

3.7
	A. Brad has a memory leak because the reverese_list routine produces a new list, made up of
	   new list nodes. The program never reclaims the old list nodes.
	
	B. The delete_list function reclaims the old list nodes, but it also reclaims the widgets,
	   which leaved the new reversed list to conatain references thad should not be there, 
	   and could lead to corrupted data.
   

3.14
	With static scoping, the program prints: 1 1 2 2. With dynamic scoping, the program
	prints: 1 1 2 1. There is a difference in whether the set_x function sees the global x
        or the x declared in the second procedure.
